            <p>These are projects done outside of school to further my tools and technology knowledge and programming ability.</p>
            
            <p><b>OpenGL Renderer</b></br>
                A project done with some of my friends that creates an API for 2D OpenGL rendering on Windows with C++. Inspired by SDL2 library elements and video tutorials by 'The Cherno' on YouTube.
            </p>

            <p><b>JUCE Audio VST</b></br>
                A project using the C++ JUCE framework to create a graphic parametric equalizer for Digital Audio Workstations. Inspired by a tutorial video with my own tweaks. Further plans include
                a separate plugin implementing wavetable synthesis.
            </p>

            <p><b>Crypto Bot</b></br>
                A solo project that uses Python and the Coinbase API to automatically trade crytocurrency. It employs a buy-low, sell-high strategy to generate profit. 
                Plans for expansion include a web dashboard to allow greater user control and tracking of progress.
            </p>

            <p><b>Discord Bot</b></br>
                A group project with some friends that mimics Discord bots that allow music playback such as FredBoat. It uses Discord.Js and the Spotify API.
            </p>

            <p><b>This Site</b></br>
                The website you see before you is crafted now in raw HTML and CSS. As I expand it I plan to port it to React.Js.
            </p>

            <h3 style='font-style: italic'>School</h3>

            <p>These projects are course-related and the specific class will be mentioned in the description.</p>

            <p><b>Homebrew Video Game Console</b></br>
                My senior capstone project done in a group. We used the Parallax Propeller MCU as a platform for a retro-style video game console similar to a Gameboy.
                It was essentially from-scratch with orignal power and audio circuits, audio, display, and storage drivers, and game programming. Additionally, all soldered on custom PCB's
                with a 3D-printed housing. My chief role in the project was with the display and audio drivers as well as the audio circuit.
            </p>

            <p><b>Social Media Clone</b></br>
                For a User Interface Design class, our group created a social media site for pet-owners in a MySQL, Express, React, and Node stack. I had full-stack responsibilities,
                and features include user registration/login, sharing posts, customizing profiles, and creating events. We achived this through Agile strategies in two week sprints.
            </p>

            <p><b>Android App</b></br>
                For a Software Development class, our group made an Android application using the Google Maps API to plot the most efficient grocery shopping route for a user. I had backend
                responsibilities and used the Spring Boot framework for Java to create API endpoints accessing our MySQL database.
            </p>

            <p><b>Autonomous Roomba</b></br>
                For an Embedded Systems class, myself along with a partner and eventually a group wrote embedded C programs to interface with a TI Tiva MCU. This unit was controlling an iRobot
                Roomba, and at the end of the class, we used our work to have it navigate an obstacle course via sensors.
