## Welcome to my site

My name is Seth Braddock, and I’m a junior in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I love my school and my degree, so I made this website to showcase what I’ve been up to the past couple of years. Here you’ll find links to my resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, and maybe even a blog.

My interest lies in anything from game design to embedded systems to even making my own circuits for guitar pedals. With experience in full-stack web development, Python, Java, and embedded C, I’d love to put my skills to work for your business.

### About Me

Originally from small town Iowa, I’ve spent my time in Ames honing my skills in the technology sector. I also love to play guitar and be outdoors in my free time.
